  This example show patterns that can be used to implement a BI report/dashboard.

  It assumes that it is connected to a MongoDB database with the Atlas sample dataset loaded.

# Define all the data connections, in this case the brands and products MongoDB collections
connections:
  - id: movies_mongodb # The connectionId that will be used when defining requests and mutations on our pages
    type: MongoDBCollection
    properties:
      databaseName: sample_mflix # The database name
      collection: movies # The collection name
      databaseUri:
        _secret: lowdefy_examples_mdb # The database connection uri that is stored as a secret and accessed using the _secret operator

# Menus used in the app can be listed here
# By default, the menu with id default, or the first menu defined is used.
# If no menu is defined, a default menu is created using all the defined pages.
menus:
  - id: default
    links:
      - id: report # Define the menu link that directs to the report page
        type: MenuLink
        pageId: report # Id of the report page
        properties:
          title: Report # Title to show on the menu
          icon: LineChartOutlined
 
# All the pages in the app are listed here
# Instead of defining the page in the lowdefy.yaml file, it is defined in its own yaml file and referenced here
pages:
  - _ref: report.yaml
